# Data Engineering Mini Project 10
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use PySpark to perform data processing on a large dataset. A Spark SQL query and a data transformation are included in this project. The dataset used is extracted from FiveThrityEight's public datasets, involving births data from 1994 - 2003. 

## Steps
1. Add PySpark to requirement.txt
2. In my.lib, create four files that perform four functions. Extract.py extract a dataset from a URL. Transform.py cleans,fliters the dataset. Load.py transforms the data into SQLite database. Query.py retrieves from the data and performs update,create, etc
3. Edit main.py to call the functions
4. Add test cases in test_main.py
5. Create output file

## Check format and test
Use make test command to test the code
